# xaxis.db
* An example to generate an waveform with the form "ax + b" just using records
* This could be useful to generate an axis with an specific delta between 
points
* on this example if you change DELTA and STARTVAL, the PV XAXIS will have
the resultant waveform

# cavmode.db
* Example of how to select a waveform using acalcout (provided by Alfio)
